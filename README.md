After two failed attempts, I'm coming back by publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge starting today! 

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:
1. Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag

Each day I'm also going to reach out to at least two people on Twitter who are also doing the challenge
Learn More and Join me!
